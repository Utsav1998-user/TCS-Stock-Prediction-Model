**📈 Stock Price Prediction Model**

● This project is a machine learning model for stock price prediction using historical stock market data. It leverages LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series forecasting, to analyze past stock prices and predict future trends.

**🔹 Features**

● Fetches historical stock price data

● Preprocesses and scales the dataset for training

● Implements an LSTM-based neural network for time-series prediction

● Visualizes actual vs predicted stock prices using Matplotlib

● Supports prediction for upcoming days/months based on past trends

**🔹 Tech Stack**

● Python

● TensorFlow / Keras – LSTM model

● Pandas & NumPy – Data handling

● Matplotlib – Visualization

● Seaborn - Visualization

● Scikit-learn – Data preprocessing

**🔹 Project Workflow**

● Data Collection - National Stock Exchange Official Website(NSE)

● Data Preprocessing (scaling, splitting into train/test sets)

● Model Building (LSTM layers with dropout regularization)

● Training & Evaluation

● Prediction & Visualization

**🔹 Use Cases**

● Stock trend analysis for educational purposes

● Time-series forecasting demonstration

● Resume project showcasing ML & Deep Learning skills
